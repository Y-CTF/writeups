# Writeups
writeups from y-ctf club activities 

## Structure

Please use the following structure when submitting a writup : `/<CTF>/<YYYY>/<category>/<task_name>/writeup_by_<nickname>.md` and `/<CTF>/<YYYY>/<category>/<task_name>/img/<nickname>/<image_name>[.png|.jpg|.gif|...]`.

  * `/<CTF>`: Respect the case of the name as it would appear on ctftime.org
  * `/<YYYY>`: The full year as CTFs are often yearly events
  * `/<category>`: Lowercase for the category, e.g. crypto, pwn, reverse...
    * Write the name of the category as it is written during that specific CTF (for example some will have pwn, others p0wn, etc.)
    * This is not obligatory, as long as we do not have duplicate categories for a given CTF, for example we do not wish to see :
      ```shell
      /DEFCON/2021/cry
      /DEFCON/2021/crypto
      /DEFCON/2021/cryptography
      ...
      ```
  * `/<task_name>`: The name of the task
  * `writeup_by_<nickname>.md` : Your writeup. You can use your nickname (github account name), or your real name if you're confortable with that, but be consistant with what you used for the `/img/<nickname>` folder, and for what you submitted in the past.


You **cannot**: use spaces in the folder and file names.

You **can**: link to your github and any relevant ressources in your writeup. This repo is to keep track of club activities, but ultimately you're the one who solved the challenge and wrote how you did it.
